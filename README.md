# Introduction
In this project, we will use the fetal deaths statistics downloaded from CDC Wonder: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133. In the fetal death dataset, there are mothers' races, fetal gender, death years, mothers' age, delivery places and counts of death. In the birth dataset, there are also years, mothers' races, mothers' ages and counts of births.

**Main questions we would like to study: **

1. We would like to find out if there any certain types of fetus are more likely to die. For example, will male fetus have lower death rate than female fetus do.
2. Combining with the birth data, we would like to study if there are any relationships between the birth rates and fetal death rates. For instance, does a certain group of mothers with high fetal death rate would therefore have low birth rate.
3. Considering the factors all together, we would like to study which one contributed the most to the fetal deaths.
