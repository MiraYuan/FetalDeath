Caveats:
"1. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes"
"fetal deaths categorized as ""Unknown"", ""Not Stated"", ""Not on Certificate"", ""Excluded"", and ""Not Reported"" from the"
"denominator when calculating percentages."
"2. Mother's Bridged Race is coded to ""Not Reported"" for the following specified years and reporting areas: 2015 - Rhode Island"
"3. Beginning in 2014, NCHS changed the standard for gestational period from the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) based gestational"
"age to the Obstetric/clinical Estimate (OE) based gestational age. This change has resulted in a discontinuity in identifying"
"fetal deaths at 20 weeks or greater for inclusion in this dataset. Refer to the User Guide to the Fetal Death Public Use File:"
