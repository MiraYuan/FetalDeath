Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' appears instead of fetal deaths and percent of total values when the death value represents 0-9 sub-national"
"events. This is because the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"2. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes"
