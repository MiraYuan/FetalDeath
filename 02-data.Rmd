# Data sources

All of our datasets were downloaded from the [**CDC Wonder API—Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request**](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133) (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133). Since CDC Wonder only provides limited numbers of *“group by”* options, we collected separate datasets to include all the variables we want to study from the API. 

## Dataset Documentation

Following is a brief introduction to the variables we studied:

**Maternal Residence: **

* State of mother's legal residence at the time of delivery

**Maternal and Parental Characteristics: **

* Mother's Race: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black or African American; White; Not Reported
* Age of Mother: classified by groups for under 15 years, and 5-year increments for 15 and older
* Age of Father: classified by groups for under 15 years, and 5-year increments for 15 and older, or not reported
* Mother's Marital Status: Married; Unmarried; Not Available

**Fetal Characteristics: **

* Year: Year of birth, 2005-2019
* Sex: Female, Male
* Plurality or Multiple Birth: Single; twin; triplet; quadruplet; quadruplet or higher; quintuplet or higher
* LMP Gestational Age: classified by groups for 20 - 23 weeks; 24 - 27 weeks; 28 - 31 weeks; 32 - 35 weeks; 36 weeks; 37-39 weeks; 39 weeks, 40 weeks; 41 weeks; 42 or more weeks; unknown; not available
* Delivery Method: Vaginal; cesarean; not stated; not reported
* Vacuum: Use of vacuum during delivery or not, or not available

**Congenital Anomalies of the Fetus:**

* Whether the fetus had anencephalus, spina bifida/meningocele, omphalocele/gastroschisis, cleft lip/palate, downs syndrome or not, or not available

## Limitations
Even though CDC Wonder can provide reliable and authoritative data, there are still some limitations. Most of the variables in the interface *Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request* we used are categorical variables, and there are only two continuous variables--*Year* and *Fetal Death* (or *Percent to Total Death*). The lack of numerical variables brought restrictions to our research. In addition, not being able to combine different datasets due to a lack of information may also decrease the multidimensionality between variables. However, since we still have various variables in each dataset to work on, this is not a big problem.
