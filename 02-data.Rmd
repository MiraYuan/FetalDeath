# Data sources

All of our datasets were downloaded from the [**CDC Wonder API—Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request**](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133) (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133). Since CDC Wonder only provides limited numbers of *“group by”* options, we collected separate datasets to include all the variables we want to study from the API.

## Limitations
Even though CDC Wonder can provide reliable and authoritative data, there are still some limitations. Most of the variables in the interface **Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request** we used are categorical variables, and there are only two continuous variables--*Year* and *Fetal Death* (or *Percent to Total Death*). The lack of numerical variables brought restrictions to our research. In addition, not being able to combine different datasets due to a lack of information may also decrease the multidimensionality between variables. However, since we still have various variables in each dataset to work on, this is not a big problem.
