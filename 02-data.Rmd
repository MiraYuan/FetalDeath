# Data sources

All of our datasets were downloaded from the [**CDC Wonder API—Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request**](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133) (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133). Since CDC Wonder only provides limited numbers of “group by” options, we needed to collect several datasets from the API. We first figuring out the variables we want to focus on and the relationships we want to study, and then downloaded informative datasets from the API.
