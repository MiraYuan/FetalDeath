It also indicates to some extent a country’s medical and health level, economic level and basic implementation level. As the most advanced developed country in the world, the United States is famous for its advanced medical technology and strong economic strength. However, the United States ranks very high in fetal mortality. The fetal mortality rate in the United States is even three times that of some developed countries (such as Japan and Sweden), which shows that fetal mortality is a serious issue that needs to be taken seriously. We believe that the death of a fetal is not only a sad tragedy for the family, but also has a very negative impact on an Aging American society. Therefore, in this project, we aim to explore the causes of fetal death. We will analyze the distribution of fetal mortality in the United States from the perspective of time and space. We will also examine whether specific characteristics of parents contribute to fetal mortality.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Dataset Documentation", " Chapter 2 Data sources All of our datasets were downloaded from the CDC Wonder API—Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133). Since CDC Wonder only provides limited numbers of “group by” options, we needed to collect several datasets from the API. We first chose some fixed variables, such as year and age, to make sure we could combine the information in the following steps. Then, we downloaded the datasets with all other variables we would like to study. 2.1 Dataset Documentation "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Dataset Missing.Values Fetal Death 0 Natality 0 Natality with gender and state 0 Thanks to CDC, all the natality datasets and fetal death datasets we downloaded don’t have any missing values. All the “NA” s or empty rows were created by the column of the dataset’s metadata. After deleting those empty rows, we got perfect datasets without any missing values.

We can clearly see a decreasing trend since 2007. Since we don’t have data before 2007, even though our graphs show there might be an increasing trend before 2007, we cannot simply make a conclusion. After further checking the movement by splitting the data into different genders, we found out that from 2007 to 2008, the female fetal death rate had a sharper decrease than male data did. This decreasing trend is a good indicator, showing an improvement in national health. It is also unsurprising: with the development of technology and medical skills, we can now detect any potential factors that lead to fetus deaths more efficiently. 5.2 Distributions of Fetal Deaths 5.3 Remarkable Fetal Characteristics 5.3.1 Most Relevant 5.3.2 Flow of Change 5.4 Maternal/Paternal Characteristics 5.4.1 Clevland plot (age vs fetal death, facet by marital status) "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Understand fetal death by region "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
