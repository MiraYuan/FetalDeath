[["index.html", "Research on Fetal Deaths Chapter 1 Introduction", " Research on Fetal Deaths Jiayi Yuan (jy3162) &amp; Yayun Luo (yl4832) 2022-05-05 Chapter 1 Introduction Fetal mortality is the measure of poor reproductive health outcomes. It also indicates, to some extent, a country’s medical and health level, economic level, and basic implementation level. As the most advanced developed country in the world, the United States is famous for its advanced medical technology and strong economic strength. However, the United States ranks very high in fetal mortality. The fetal mortality rate in the United States is even three times that of some developed countries (such as Japan and Sweden), which shows that fetal mortality is a serious issue that needs to be taken seriously. We believe that the death of a fetal is not only a sad tragedy for the family but also has a very negative impact on an Aging American society. Therefore, in this project, we aim to explore the causes of fetal death. We will analyze the distribution of fetal mortality in the United States from the perspective of time and space. We will also examine whether specific fetal and parental characteristics contribute to fetal mortality.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Dataset Documentation 2.2 Limitations", " Chapter 2 Data sources All of our datasets were downloaded from the CDC Wonder API—Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D133). Since CDC Wonder only provides limited numbers of “group by” options, we collected separate datasets to include all the variables we want to study from the API. 2.1 Dataset Documentation Following is a brief introduction to the variables we studied: Death: Total numbers fetal deaths Percentage of fetal deaths to total numbers of deaths Maternal Residence: State of mother’s legal residence at the time of delivery Maternal and Parental Characteristics: Mother’s Race: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black or African American; White; Not Reported Age of Mother: classified by groups for under 15 years, and 5-year increments for 15 and older Age of Father: classified by groups for under 15 years, and 5-year increments for 15 and older, or not reported Mother’s Marital Status: Married; Unmarried; Not Available Fetal Characteristics: Year: Year of birth, 2005-2019 Sex: Female, Male Delivery Weight: classfied by groups of 249 grams or less; 250 - 349 grams, 350 - 499 grams, 500 gram increments up to 4999 grams; 5000 - 8165 grams; unknown or not stated Plurality or Multiple Birth: Single; twin; triplet; quadruplet; quadruplet or higher; quintuplet or higher LMP Gestational Age: classified by groups for 20 - 23 weeks; 24 - 27 weeks; 28 - 31 weeks; 32 - 35 weeks; 36 weeks; 37-39 weeks; 39 weeks, 40 weeks; 41 weeks; 42 or more weeks; unknown; not available Delivery Method: Vaginal; cesarean; not stated; not reported Vacuum: Use of vacuum during delivery or not, or not available Congenital Anomalies of the Fetus: Whether the fetus had congenital anencephalus, spina bifida/meningocele, omphalocele/gastroschisis, cleft lip/palate, downs syndrome or not, or not available 2.2 Limitations Even though CDC Wonder can provide reliable and authoritative data, there are still some limitations. Perhaps there was a change in the documentary system, some of the variables do not have consistent recording style. For example, the variable plurality of birth has records of quintuplet or higher from 2005-2018, but changed to quadruplet or higher in 2019. Most of the variables in the interface Fetal Deaths, 2005-2019 Request we used are categorical variables, and there are only two continuous variables–Year and Fetal Death (or Percent to Total Death). The lack of numerical variables brought restrictions to our research. In addition, not being able to combine different datasets due to a lack of information may also decrease the multidimensionality between variables. However, since we still have various variables in each dataset to work on, this is not a big problem. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Since we chose the features we would like to use when we collected our data, we do not need to do additional work in R to select the variables. What is more, thanks to CDC Wonder, all the data files we collected were already in the tidy version. CDC Wonder always renders the metadata in a Note column and a codes column for each variable. We believe these pieces of information are unnecessary, so we simply deleted them to make our datasets more readable and save environmental space. What else we focused on was to figure out what values should be changed to missing values, for instance, values recorded as unknown or not stated. Besides, as mentioned before, in the Limitation section of our data, we checked any inconsistencies in the statistics and merged them in reasonable ways. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Fetal Characteristics Dataset 4.2 Congenital Anomalies Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values Since we are using separate datasets, not every dataset has missing values. Only the datasets contain the variables that have the categories of “not available” or “not stated” have missing values. Some of the variables that contain these two categories have too few factor levels and are not crucial. Therefore, we will not show all missing values visually in this section, and we only choose two datasets that we believe are representative to study their missing patterns in detail. We will have more discussions on why the variables were not available in the Conclusion chapter. 4.1 Fetal Characteristics Dataset As we can see from the graphs, most rows in the dataset we used to study fetal characteristics do not have any missing values, and only a tiny part of the rows miss more than two variables. We can notice that, from most to least, the missed variables are LMP Gestational Age, Infant Delivery Weight, and Delivery Method. We think the miss of this data was because of difficulties in documenting, unnecessity of recording, or informality of the delivery places. 4.2 Congenital Anomalies Dataset By checking the missing patterns of the dataset we used to study fetuses’ congenital anomalies, we notice that there are only two situations: complete cases and miss of all congenital anomalies data. Even though more than 25% of rows missed all congenital data, it was because the variables were recorded as “Not stated” and “Not available,” which doubled the number of NA values. Since we focused on each congenital anomaly separately, we do not need to worry too much about the rows that missed all the data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Fetal Deaths Over Years 5.2 Geographical Distribution 5.3 Fetal Characteristics 5.4 Maternal/Paternal Characteristics", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Fetal Deaths Over Years First of all, let us take a look at how the fetal death numbers changed between 2005 and 2019. We can clearly see a decreasing trend since 2007 (hover mouse to the point to see the exact number). After further checking the movement by splitting the data into different genders, we found out that from 2007 to 2008, the female fetal death numbers had a sharper decrease, but male fetal death numbers had an increase. We should notice that boys’ birth rates are always higher than girls’ birth rates, and therefore, it is reasonable to see more dead male fetuses than dead female fetuses. 5.2 Geographical Distribution From the graph above, we can clearly see the distribution of fetal deaths in each US state. We found that CA, TX, FL, GA, PA, NY, and IL accounted for the largest numbers of total fetal deaths in the United States. The states with the highest number of fetal deaths are mostly along the coast. However, some northern states (ex. MT, ND, ME, VT…) have very low numbers of fetal deaths, and we think perhaps this was because of the low birth rates or small populations in these states. 5.3 Fetal Characteristics 5.3.1 Infant Delivery Weights According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the average weight at birth for a full-term baby boy is 3,300 grams (g). The average full-term baby girl weighs 3,200g at birth. The average baby born at 37 to 40 weeks weighs between 2,500 to 4,000 grams. Birth weights less than 2,500 grams will be considered low birth weights. The figure above shows that fetuses with a birth weight of 500-999 grams and fetuses with a birth weight of 350-499 grams died the most. The number of deaths of fetuses with birth weights in these two ranges was much higher than for any other birth weight. Not only that, but we can also see that the top numbers of deaths of fetuses were under 2500 grams of birth weight. So we can conclude that underweight fetuses have a higher mortality rate. However, the data shows that the number of fetal deaths outside the average range of fetal weight is low. 5.3.2 Plurality of Birth In this part, we analyze whether the plurality of birth affects the number of fetal death. The above plot is a violin plot. The violin plot effectively shows not only median, range, and variability, but also data distribution and its probability density. From the chart above, we can see that single births have the widest distribution of fetal deaths and the highest number of fetal deaths. This is not surprising, as in most cases, there is only one infant from a single pregnancy. Just as we expected, we can see the number of dead fetuses decrease with more births in one pregnancy, as fewer pregnancies have multiple births. By checking the boxplots in the violin plots, we notice that the distributions of all four groups are not normal. It is worth noting that only Triplet has a right-skewed distribution, and single birth has the most left-skewed distribution. 5.3.3 Infant Delivery Method Based on the number of dead fetuses, we would like to understand the relationship between the different delivery methods and the number of fetuses per birth. Above is a mosaic plot, and we can see an association between the delivery method and the plurality of birth. As we can see, more single births were vaginally delivered, but as the number of birth in a pregnancy increases, cesarean delivery is more likely to opt. 5.3.4 Gestational Age ## [1] 57024 We believe that another factor determining whether a fetus will survive in good health is the mother’s gestational age. So we plotted the number of dead fetuses at different gestational ages. In the bar chart above, we can see that the highest number of fetal deaths occurred at the gestational age of 20-23 weeks, and the odds of surviving fetuses were higher for gestational age over 40 weeks. The data provided by the World Health Organization can also verify our results. According to the data provided by the World Health Organization, we know that delivery within 28 weeks requires modern medical technology. Otherwise, the survival rate of the fetus is very low or is zero. 5.4 Maternal/Paternal Characteristics 5.4.1 Parents’ Ages We believe that fetal death is also related to some parental characteristics, for instance, the age of the mother and the age of the father. So we plotted the number of fetal deaths caused by different maternal ages and paternal ages. We found that when the mother’s age and the father’s age are both between 25 and 29, the number of fetal deaths is the highest. Another age group with a high number of fetal deaths was that both mothers and fathers were between 30 and 34 years old. 5.4.2 Materanl Races and Materanl Marital Status In this section, we aim to investigate the effect of the mother’s race and the mother’s marital status on the number of fetal deaths. We plotted the two independent variables, the mother’s race, and the mother’s marriage. In the Cleveland plot above, we can see that white mothers had the highest number of fetal deaths, and American Indian or Alaska Native mothers had the lowest number of fetal deaths. For whites and Asians or Pacific Islanders, the numbers of fetal deaths were higher for married mothers than for unmarried mothers. The other two groups had more deaths when their mothers were unmarried. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Select Congenital Anomalies of Fetuses in the US 6.2 Changes in Numbers of Fetal Deaths Among Different Maternal Ages in Different Years", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Select Congenital Anomalies of Fetuses in the US We believe fetuses’ congenital anomalies are also critical features of fetal deaths. Therefore, we considered visualizing if there were any geographical patterns of the dead fetuses who had congenital anomalies. CDC provides statistics for five selected congenital anomalies: Anencephalus, Spina Bifida/Meningocele, Omphalocele/Gastroschisis, Cleft Lip/Palate, and Downs Syndrome. In the graph above, we can see how many fetuses died with a particular congenital anomaly in each state in the US by using the drop-down box in the upper-right corner to select the anomaly we are interested in. Because the numbers were small, the percent to total death numbers in each state were even smaller and hard to interpret, we believe using the fetus death number directly is more reasonable. We can see more detailed information by hovering the mouse over a specific state: the state name and the corresponding death number. The legend bar on the right shows the color distribution for a certain anomaly, with darker color indicating the larger number and lighter color indicating the smaller number. The states with a zero death number for a certain anomaly are either did not have any fetuses who died with the anomaly, or the data was not available. After checking these choropleth maps, we noticed that more dead fetuses have congenital anencephalus and downs syndrome, and congenital spina bifida/meningocele is the anomaly fetuses least likely to have. For each anomaly, there is at least one state has a death number much higher than other states do: North Dakota has the most fetuses died with anencephalus Iowa has the most fetuses died with spina bifida/meningocele New Hampshire has the most fetuses died with omphalocele/gastroschisis New Mexico has the most fetuses died with cleft lip/palate North Carolina, Arkansas, and Connecticut have the most fetuses died with downs syndrome. 6.2 Changes in Numbers of Fetal Deaths Among Different Maternal Ages in Different Years In order to have a better understanding of how mothers’ age would affect fetus death, we construct the above graph to demonstrate how the number of fetal death changed over years for each maternal age group. Either use the drop-down box at the bottom, or simply hover the mouse over a specific color fill to choose a specific age we want to focus. The ages are incremental from the bottom to the top, with youngest mothers at the bottom and oldest mothers at the top. By sliding around the mouse in the selected age group (the selected color fill), we can see a detailed report of the death number in each year for this age group in the upper left corner. The x-axis is years and the y-axis is fetal death numbers. By comparing the size of each color fill, we can have a intuitive view of how the numbers of fetal deaths are different from each other, and how they changed over time. As we can see, most dead fetuses had mothers aged from 20 to 34; over 50 years old or under 15 years old are the two groups containing the smallest number of dead fetuses, as fewer mothers give birth at these ages. From 2005 to 2019, we can see a shrink in the number of dead fetuses. We expect all age groups had such shrink. However, this was not the case. Most of the shrink was contributed by age groups 15-19 and 20-24-year-old mothers. Mothers from other age groups have fluctuated dead fetuses instead of a continuous decrease in the numbers.
