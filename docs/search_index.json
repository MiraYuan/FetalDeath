It also indicates to some extent a country’s medical and health level, economic level and basic implementation level. As the most advanced developed country in the world, the United States is famous for its advanced medical technology and strong economic strength. However, the United States ranks very high in fetal mortality. The fetal mortality rate in the United States is even three times that of some developed countries (such as Japan and Sweden), which shows that fetal mortality is a serious issue that needs to be taken seriously. We believe that the death of a fetal is not only a sad tragedy for the family, but also has a very negative impact on an Aging American society. Therefore, in this project, we aim to explore the causes of fetal death. We will analyze the distribution of fetal mortality in the United States from the perspective of time and space. We will also examine whether specific characteristics of parents contribute to fetal mortality.

Since CDC Wonder only provides limited numbers of “group by” options, we needed to collect several datasets from the API.

We can clearly see a decreasing trend since 2007. Since we don’t have data before 2007, even though our graphs show there might be an increasing trend before 2007, we cannot simply make a conclusion. After further checking the movement by splitting the data into different genders, we found out that from 2007 to 2008, the female fetal death rate had a sharper decrease than male data did. We should notice that our graph shows higher death rates for male fetuses. This is not because male fetuses have a higher possibility of death but because male fetuses have higher birth rates in general. This decreasing trend is a good indicator, showing an improvement in national health. It is also unsurprising: with the development of technology and medical skills, we can now detect any potential factors that lead to fetus deaths more efficiently. 5.2 Geographical Distribution 5.3 Remarkable Fetal Characteristics 5.3.1 Does Infant Weights matters? 5.3.2 Relationships between delivery method and plurality of birth 5.3.3 LMP weeks 5.4 Maternal/Paternal Characteristics 5.4.1 Clevland plot "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
